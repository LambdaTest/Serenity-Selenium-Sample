* [Local Testing With Serenity](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Serenity, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment** i.e. **JDK 1.6 to JDK 1.8**. 

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on TestMu AI Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven** which supports **JUnit** framework out of the box. **Maven** can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

### Cloning Repo And Installing Dependencies

**Step 1:** Clone the TestMu AI’s Serenity-Selenium-Sample repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Serenity-Selenium-Sample
cd Serenity-Selenium-Sample
```

You may also want to run the command below to check for outdated dependencies.

```bash
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your TestMu AI credentials with you to run test automation scripts. You can get these credentials from the [TestMu AI Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=serenity-selenium-sample) or by your [TestMu AI Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=serenity-selenium-sample).

**Step 2:** Set TestMu AI **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

* For **Linux/macOS**:
  
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"

## Run Your First Test

>**Test Scenario**: To run your first Serenity Test on LambdaTest Selenium Grid, let’s understand our test case scenario, the test case below checks for the word "**LambdaTest**" on Google and tests if the title of the resultant page is "**LambdaTest-Google Search**".

```bash
Feature: Google's Search Functionality
    Scenario: Can find search results
        When I type query as "LambdaTest"
        And I submit
        Then I should see title "LambdaTest - Google Search"
```

Following below is the `GooglePage.java` file for the above Test Case Scenario.

```java title="GooglePage.java"
package com.lambdatest.cucumber.pages;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy;

import net.serenitybdd.core.pages.WebElementFacade;
import net.thucydides.core.annotations.DefaultUrl;
import net.thucydides.core.pages.PageObject;

@DefaultUrl("https://www.google.com/ncr")
public class GooglePage extends PageObject {

    @FindBy(name = "q")
    WebElementFacade search;

    @FindBy(name = "btnK")
    WebElementFacade searchButton;

    public void searchForString(String searchString) {
        search.sendKeys(searchString);
    }
 public void submitForm() throws Exception {
        searchButton.click();
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    }

    public void titleShouldMatch(String matchTitle) {
        assertThat(this.getTitle()).containsIgnoringCase(matchTitle);
    }
}
```

Below is the `TestMu AISerenityDriver.java` file that shows the integration of Serenity with LambdaTest.

```java title="LambdaTestSerenityDriver.java"
package com.lambdatest;

import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Iterator;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver;

import net.thucydides.core.util.EnvironmentVariables;
import net.thucydides.core.util.SystemEnvironmentVariables;
import net.thucydides.core.webdriver.DriverSource;

public class LambdaTestSerenityDriver implements DriverSource {

    public WebDriver newDriver() {
        EnvironmentVariables environmentVariables = SystemEnvironmentVariables.createEnvironmentVariables();

        String username = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME");
        if (username == null) {
            username = (String) environmentVariables.getProperty("lt.user");
        }

        String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY");
        if (accessKey == null) {
            accessKey = (String) environmentVariables.getProperty("lt.key");
        }

        String environment = System.getProperty("environment");
                DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("plugin","Serenity LambdaTest Plugin");

        Iterator it = environmentVariables.getKeys().iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            String key = (String) it.next();

            if (key.equals("lt.user") || key.equals("lt.key") || key.equals("lt.grid")) {
                continue;
            } else if (key.startsWith("lt_")) {
                capabilities.setCapability(key.replace("lt_", ""), environmentVariables.getProperty(key));

            } else if (environment != null && key.startsWith("environment." + environment)) {

                capabilities.setCapability(key.replace("environment." + environment + ".", ""),
                        environmentVariables.getProperty(key));
            }
        }

        try {
            String url = "https://" + username + ":" + accessKey + "@" + environmentVariables.getProperty("lt.grid")
                    + "/wd/hub";
            return new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(url), capabilities);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            return null;
        }
    }

    public boolean takesScreenshots() {
        return false;
    }
}
```

You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt [Desired Capability Generator](https://www.testmuai.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=serenity-selenium-sample).


### Executing the Test

**Step 3:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
mvn verify -P single
```

## Run Your Parallel Test Using Serenity


To run parallel tests with Serenity, we will run **single.feature** test case in four different environments Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari.

```java title="ParallelChromeTest.java"
//Running Parallel Test On Chrome

@RunWith(CucumberWithSerenity.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/features/single.feature")
public class ParallelChromeTest extends LambdaTestSerenityTest {
}
```

Similarly we define the class for the remaining browsers.

### Executing Parallel Tests Using Serenity

To run parallel tests using Serenity, we would have to execute the below commands in the terminal:

```bash
mvn verify -P parallel
```

## Testing Locally Hosted Or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with TestMu AI Selenium grid using TestMu AI Tunnel. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using tunnel and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. TestMu AI Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are live.

Refer our [TestMu AI Tunnel documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=serenity-selenium-sample) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish TestMu AI Tunnel.

Download the binary file of:
* [TestMu AI Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [TestMu AI Tunnel for macOS](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [TestMu AI Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:

```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **TestMu AI Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();        
        capabilities.setCapability("tunnel", true);
```

👋 Welcome to TestMu AI, the next evolution of LambdaTest. As of January 2026, [LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/) - we have evolved from a cross-browser testing cloud into a unified, AI-native quality engineering platform designed for the modern DevOps era.

Whether you have been part of the LambdaTest community for years or are just discovering TestMu AI, our mission remains the same: to help you ship faster with high-scale test execution, autonomous testing, and deep quality analytics.

### 🔄 Our Rebrand Journey

In 2017, we introduced LambdaTest with a clear mission: to become the world's most trusted cloud testing platform. We built a scalable, high-performance test cloud that eliminated flakiness, improved developer feedback cycles, and accelerated release velocity for teams worldwide.

As LambdaTest grew, we expanded the platform into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the entire testing lifecycle. These capabilities enabled teams to test any stack, on any technology, at enterprise scale.

Over time, we rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up. What began as LambdaTest's high-performance testing cloud has now evolved into TestMu AI, an AI-native, multi-agent platform redefining modern quality engineering.

We chose the name TestMu AI to reflect our shift towards intelligent, autonomous testing. While our identity has changed, our core technology and commitment to the testing community stay the same.
